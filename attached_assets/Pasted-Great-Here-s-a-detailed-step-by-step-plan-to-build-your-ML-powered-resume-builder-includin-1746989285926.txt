Great! Here's a **detailed step-by-step plan** to build your **ML-powered resume builder**, including how to get or build datasets **for free**, and implement smart features.

## üí° Project: **Smart Resume Builder with ML/NLP**

---

### üß± **1. Project Architecture Overview**

```
Frontend (React or HTML/JS)
        ‚Üì
Backend (Flask/Django or Node.js)
        ‚Üì
ML/NLP Modules (Skill gap, scoring, summary generation)
        ‚Üì
Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL for user resumes)
        ‚Üì
PDF Generator (ReportLab / jsPDF / xhtml2pdf)
```

---

## üîπ **2. Core Features & Implementation Plan**

---

### üî∏ A. Resume Upload or Form Builder

* **Option 1**: Upload Resume as PDF (use `pdfminer.six` or `PyMuPDF` to extract text)
* **Option 2**: Interactive Form (collect Name, Experience, Education, Skills, etc.)

---

### üî∏ B. Skill Gap Analyzer (ML/NLP)

**Goal**: Match resume to a job description and highlight missing or weak skills.

* **Approach**:

  1. Use NLP to extract nouns and verbs (skills) from resume and JD.
  2. Use a skill keyword dataset (see below) or embeddings (like Word2Vec).
  3. Compare overlap percentage and suggest improvements.

* **Tools**: `spaCy`, `nltk`, cosine similarity

* **Dataset Sources**:

  * [Indeed Job Listings Scraped (via Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/indeed-dataset-job-postings)
  * [Open Skills API](https://www.skills.emsidata.com/) (for mapping roles to required skills)

---

### üî∏ C. Resume Scoring Model

**Goal**: Score a resume based on grammar, skill richness, and keyword presence.

* **Approach**:

  * Build a dataset of resumes (good vs poor) from:

    * Kaggle resume datasets
    * Open samples from GitHub
    * Create synthetic variations using prompt engineering
  * Train a simple classifier (Logistic Regression or fine-tuned BERT)

* **Features**:

  * Number of quantified achievements
  * Action verbs
  * Section presence (projects, experience)
  * Grammar score (via `language_tool_python`)

* **Dataset Ideas**:

  * [Kaggle: Resume Dataset (Job Titles, Categories)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/resume-dataset)
  * [Resume Parser Demo Resumes](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume)

---

### üî∏ D. Grammar & ATS Optimization

* **Goal**: Check grammar, passive voice, clarity, and ATS keyword matching.
* **Tools**:

  * [`language_tool_python`](https://github.com/myint/language-check)
  * ATS keyword checklist based on job role

---

### üî∏ E. Job Title Prediction

* **Goal**: Predict the most suitable job title from resume content.
* **Model**: Multi-class classification
* **Dataset**:

  * Use labeled resume datasets like the one above
  * Map skills and experience to titles (data scientist, web dev, etc.)

---

### üî∏ F. Summary Generator (Auto Resume Summary)

* **Goal**: Generate a 2‚Äì3 sentence professional summary using resume content.
* **Tools**:

  * T5 or GPT-based summarizer (like `transformers` from HuggingFace)
  * Fine-tune if needed, or just use pretrained models (T5, BART)
